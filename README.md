# Simple Quiz App about beer and alcohol in general. 
To each question, four answers are given, but only one is correct. 
Currently the game has only two gamemodes, the first is inspired by "Who Want's to be a Millionaire": 

- Answer correctly and yout proceed to the next, more difficult question. 
- Answer wrong, and you lose and must start over. 
- Answer enough (five) questions correctly and you win the quiz. 

The second gamemode is 25 questions in a row, and see hom many you answered correctly in the end. 
The correct answer is not given when answering incorrectly, otherwise it would be too easy :-) 

## Roadmap
- [ ] Actual artwork and better style (somewhat done)
- [x] Refactoring most of the codebase
- [ ] Statistics for games played 
- [ ] Localization (Basically a translation of the questions)




### New gamemodes: 
- [ ] Try to answer as many questions correctly in a given time (say a minute). 
- [x] Test your knowledge by answering all questions and see how many where correct.
